# Genius - Eduzz Fullstack Developer Bootcamp [dio.me] ðŸŽ®
Genius game project developed at DIO - Eduzz Fullstack Developer Bootcamp.

This project was very meaninful for me because I could reinforce the new ablilities acquired troughout of this course until now. See the JS line codes working well give me confidence to go ahead.

My main dificulties was in JS, like I was suposed, but the experience of create this game help me to understand better the syntax and elements of JS, especially in functions and arrow functions. Now I know better what a I need do revise and I believe wich the concepts of JS are more estabilished in my mind.

Thanks to Gabriela Prinheiro to present the class and DIO and Eduzz for bootcamp.
